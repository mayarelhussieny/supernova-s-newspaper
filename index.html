    <h2>information about IEEE and supernova</h2>
    <p>IEEE is the world's largest non-profit organization working to develop and innovate the latest technologies in the world of electricity, electronics, engineering and computer science.</p>
    <p>Most of the great inventions in the field of technology were this organization behind them like: <ins>Bluetooth, computer, wireless networks(WAN/LAN),wifi,winmax and other inventions;</ins></p>

    <h2> supernova's galaxy</h2>
    <p>Is an astronomical event occurring during the last evolutionary stages of the life of a huge star,</p>
         <p>where a massive star explosion is carried out in the space at the end of his life,</p>
          <p>and this leads to a spherical cloud around the star, and very bright (sparkling) of the plasma,</p>
           <p>In space and turn into invisible objects in a matter of weeks or months. The center of the star collapses itself toward the center,</p>
            <p>forming either white dwarf or turning into a neutron star, depending on the mass of the star;</p>
            <p>i think this name related to the name of the teamBecause this explosion is renewed and occurs a lot of light and energy. </p>
